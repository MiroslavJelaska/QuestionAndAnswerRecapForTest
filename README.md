QuestionAndAnswerRecapForTest
=============================

SideProject done for fun.
It serves as a recap for test. It contains questions and answers for recap. (Note that only few Q&A are provided)

Details:
*  Uses MathJax(http://www.mathjax.org/) to render all the mathematical expressions
*  All Q&A are stored in .json files
*  All images used in Q&A are SVG
*  AngularJS

Notes:
*  TeX (contains bug)/(has problem rendering) "\oiint"
*  Design is a mess, CSS code is a mess (nor LESS nor SASS were used)
*  mathjaxBind directive work for cases that I assumed, but is far from perfect and can break in certain situations
